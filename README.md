# Arduino

During my final semester in the Automation and Robotics program, I worked on an automated retrieval system controlled by an Arduino. 

One of the goals of this design was to demonstrate the execution of a project at this level of post-secondary education: a fully functional robotic pick and place similar to those in industrial use. Just like most industrial robotic arms represented by the names of ABB, Fanuc, and Motoman, this robotic arm is capable of rotating about a central axis, traversing linearly to reach higher or lower vertical points, and reaching specific targets with the aid of 4 servo motors strategically placed in 4 joints of the robotic arm. The rigidity of the design is also crucial for smooth operation. The remainder of the project, consisting of the working area, is purely of mechanical construction.

The Program attached to this repository showcases the following:

1) C++ programming for Arduino
2) Pin Configuration
3) Usage of the AccelStepper library to control a stepper motor
4) Integration of a keypad to the Arduino for user input
5) Coordinated axis movements of servo motors
